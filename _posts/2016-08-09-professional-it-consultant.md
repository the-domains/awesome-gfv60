Professional IT Consultant

I'm a highly experienced, qualified and accomplished Senior IT Professional with a string of "firsts" to my name, achieved in my successful career at globally renowned brewer SABMiller. These include developing their global Network and Telecommunications Strategy and unified communications strategy; first hosted contact centre in South Africa; first network architecture for SAP single instance; and the company's first deployment of Cisco IP telephony. I've worked my way up to one of the highest technical roles in the organisation (Global Enterprise Architect - Communications), and along the way been recognised with the MD's Award in 2007 and Cisco's award for Best Data Centre Design in 2008\.

I consider myself more than a technical expert. It is critical that IT supports the goals and standards of the business and all my Architectures and Designs are aligned to the business vision with the focus on achieving bottom-line results. Although a champion of new and innovative technology this is never at the expense of commercial practicality. I'm also an excellent communicator, who enjoys leading and motivating teams to deliver their best, and able to build long lasting and productive relationships with all types of colleagues and suppliers. 

Throughout my career, at SABMiller and before, I have applied myself to continual learning and have been certified by Cisco and Microsoft as well as completing numerous courses covering many aspects of IT and business, notably service management and delivery. I feel is it is critical to have a broad knowledge of the IT arena and how it fits in today's business and society. I take a lot of satisfaction from solving complex problems, with a good eye for detail and an analytical and systematic approach.   
My career has involved a lot of travel and working with people all around the globe which has been exciting and stimulating, but there's nothing I like better than being home with my family.
